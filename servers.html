                <p>When your business gets to a certain size you are going to find it difficult to manage lots of computers individually. Each computer needs to have users created on them, email setup on them, programs and printers installed individually. All this takes time end effort to manage and repeat many of the same things on each of these computers. It all gets more difficult if your users want to be able to move between the computers you have regularly. You will often find managing files that need to be shared between your users becomes a very difficult proposition never mind ensuring the data you have spread out over these machines is protected and backed up correctly. </p>
