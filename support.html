                            	<li><span class="LIHeader">Telephone Support - </span><br /><br />For most people this is where your support begins, calling us and discussing the problem you have. In the case of simple questions or problems it may be possible to solve problems with this simple telephone call.<br /><br /></li>
                                <li><span class="LIHeader">Remote Support - </span><br /><br />
                                Remote support is suitable for more indepth problems that are not as easily solved by a phone call. For remote support to work though it is necessary for you at least to have a working and functioning internet connection. This type of support is best suited to situations such as installing, configuring some software and updating settings as well as checking visually problems that you may be experiencing and giving/showing you some solutions. For remote support please follow the instructions on the following <a href="remote.html">remote support</a> page.<br />
                                <br /></li>
                                <li><span class="LIHeader">Onsite Support - </span><br /><br />Onsite support is provided for situations where the problem cannot be solved simply, where remote support is not possible due to a lack of interenet connection or finally for situations where physical work is required such as hardware repairs. In this case our engineers will arrange a suitable time with you to visit your home or business and carry out the work required. In a few cases this may involve removing equipment for repair and returning it to your location again once it is finished.<br /><br /></li>
                                <li><span class="LIHeader">Maintenance Support - </span><br /><br />
                                Maintenance support is provided for both customers and businesses that require a large amount of support or would like to have their computers or networks regularly maintained. It is however mainly aimed at the business level. This type of support will include various combinations of all the previous types of support with regular visits and pro-active work in order to ensure your systems are less likely to experience problems. Maintenance contracts for this type of support can be provided if requested and you can find out more information and request a quote by getting in contact. In a few cases our engineers may also recommend this type of contracted support if they feel it would be of benefit or reduce costs for you. </li>
